# Secure-UDP-Server
Lab from CS118 UCLA

I developed with a partner a C program to implement a UDP server with reliable data transfer
 - Retrieves and displays images and HTML files 
 
 - Makefile is used to compile webserver.c and remove webserver (executable) 
 - report.pdf is a summary of our efforts and displays the functionality of the server in mulitple side cases
 - webserver.c is the C code that impliments the server
